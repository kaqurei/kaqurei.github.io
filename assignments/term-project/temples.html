                <h3>Salt Lake Utah Temple</h3>
                <p>The Salt Lake City Utah Temple took 40 years to build, with its highly ornate interior being
                    completed in just a year. It was the only temple dedicated by President Wilford Woodruff, in April
                    1893. Positioned on Salt Lake City's center block, known as Temple Square, the spires of the Salt
                    Lake Temple rise amid downtown high-rises and super malls. Every holiday season, Temple Square is
                    transformed into a highly popular display of hundreds of thousands of Christmas lights. In General
                    Conference April 2019, President Russel M Nelson announced that the Salt Lake Temple will be closing
                    for extensive renovations.</p>

                <p>The beautiful Jordan River Utah Temple was the seventh temple built in Utah, dedicated unto the Lord
                    in 1981. Marion G. Romney, a member of the church's First Presidency, dedicated the Jordan River
                    Temple in fifteen sessions held during November 16-20, 1981. More than 160,000 members attended the
                    dedicatory services. Thirty of those in attendance at the dedication were elderly men and women who
                    had been at the historic dedication of the first temple in the Salt Lake Valley, the Salt Lake
                    Temple.Most had been very young at the time but still remembered the event. It was closed for
                    extensive renovations in August 2015, and rededicated three years later in May 2018 by President
                    Henry B Eyring of the First Presidency.</p>
